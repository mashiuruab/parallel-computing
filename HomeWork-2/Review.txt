Moore's law is the observation that the number of components (transistors, resistors and capacitors) in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.

Dennard Scaling is a method to scale down transistors but maintaining a constant power density. The power density means energy produces in a square unit of chip area. It is proportional to switching speed and the number of transistors in a unit area. From Denard scaling we know that the power density stays constant as transistors get smaller so the power used is proportional to area.

The S-curve is a mathmatical model describes the growth of two variables in terms of one another over time. In business the S curve model is used to describe and predict the performance of a company or a product over a period of time.

4.

Yes Moore's law is dead now. It has sustained for five decades.

5.

The Exponential growth depends on three levels of adoption in the computing ecosystem. These are chip, system, and community. 
Yes Exponential growth is likely to be sustained for many more years.
